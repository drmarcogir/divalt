An R package for analysing species diversity patterns along elevational gradients. This package is meant to provide a collection of useful functions for the analyses of elevational diversity patterns.

The package can be installed by typing:

```r
# the devtools package is needed to be able to load the package
# install.packages("divalt")
library(devtools)
install_github("marcog77/divalt")
library(divalt)
``` 
# Example usage
What follows are some simple examples of how this package can be used to analyse elevational diversity patterns.


## Beta diversity between altitudinal bands
The function `betacar()` calculates beta diversity between altitudinal bands starting from a community data matrix following the methods implemented in Carvahlo et al. (2012) and
Baselga et al. (2011). The function can be applied to a dataset containing data from one of more elevationa gradients. The function
